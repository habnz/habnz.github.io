CantHAB uses the standard developed by [UKHAS](http://ukhas.org.uk/) for
our balloon telemetry.  This means we can make use of the wide range of
experience UKHAS has to offer, and also use the considerable infrastructure
they have built for tracking balloon flights on-line, including live
position updates on [Spacenear.us](http://spacenear.us/tracker/).

The best source of instructions on how to track a flight are available
in the [beginners guide to tracking using dl-fldigi](http://ukhas.org.uk/guides:tracking_guide)
on the UKHAS website.  There is also a good guide available from the
Australian [Project Horus](http://projecthorus.org/index.php/tracking/)
website.

In short the equipment you will need is:

* A radio receiver capable of receiving SSB at 70cm (~ 434MHz)
* A suitable antenna (yagi is best).
* A laptop, plus an internet connection if you wish to publish your data
  to the internet.

If you have any questions, please contact the team at canthab@hab.org.nz.
We may also be available on IRC (Freenode) in #highaltitude.  HAMs may be able
to contact us on the Christchurch 70cm and 2m repeaters at various times via
one of our team (ZL3ML).
