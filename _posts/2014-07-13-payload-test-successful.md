Today's payload test was a big success, and has cleared the way for our first
launch.

The topography here gives us a great opportunity for this kind of test.  The
hills of Banks Peninsula stand alone with 300m elevation over the plains with a
huge line of sight to the north and west.

Dean and Iain were tied up today, so I (Malc - ZL3ML)  headed up the Port Hills
and secreted the payload in a tree with a panoramic view over the Canterbury
plains.  Almost immeadiately the call came through from Rob (ZL3AKM) that he
could hear the transmission loud and clear in the city 10km away with just a
rubber duck antenna.

After a quick coffee stop I headed out west across the plains to see how far
I could pick up the transmitter.  As I got beyond West Melton, about 30km
from the payload, the signal was still coming through loud and clear with
my home made beam antenna, and I decided that was far enough.  10mW can go
a long way!

Despite a couple of glitches to be ironed out with the GPS things are looking
good for our first launch.  We have a couple of pieces of hardware to come
together, and then we will await a launch window in the coming weeks.

Huge thanks again to Rob ZL3AKM for taking the time to track the payload today
and for keeping me company on the radio as I drove up and down the hills :)

Stay tuned in the coming weeks for news of our first launch.
