In the run up to our first flight, we will be performing some payload
testing.  Would-be trackers are heartily encouraged to try out their set-up
during these tests.

We are intending on testing our payload transmission from the Port Hills
on Sun July 13th 2014.

Weather permitting we will have the payload operational from around 11am to
2pm.  You will be able to test end to end decoding of the payload telemetry
sentences during this time.  Range is unknown at this time, but if you have
line of sight to Sugar Loaf you should be able to pick up the payload with
a beam antenna.

If you are planning on tracking any of our flights
this is a great opportunity to test your system.  Details of how to track
our payloads is on the [tracking](/tracking/) page.

Full details of the payload telemetry settings will be posted here mid week.
